It usually just has one title, just like a document section would. The nesting of the topics on different levels in your Publication is what creates the heading levels as you'll see. This topic will describe some of the steps for you to start creating your own. But feel free to play around with this one too. You can always get a quick preview of what your output would look like when publishing to PDF or HTML in the Preview tab. Later when you have created your own layouts you can also use that layout for the preview. (This is not the same as publishing your final output, which you would normally do for an entire publication, not just an individual topic.) Create a new topic. You can do this in two ways: Either click the Create content button at the top of the Content Manager , and select Topic . Or click Create content in the context menu next to a folder: Give the topic a name in the dialog, and then click Ok . Ctrl-click (or Cmd-click on a Mac) on the new topic in the Content Manager to open the topic in a new browser tab.

"body" : "Even if one of the most efficient types of reuse in Paligo is the reuse of entire topics in Publications, as already covered, you also have a number of techniques at your disposal to make a single topic more reusable, as well as reuse content within the topic. Text fragment reuse This is a very powerful feature in Paligo. You can simply copy any element, using the Paligo \"Copy and Paste as Reuse\" commands: Try this now : Copy an element, using the special \"Copy element\" command, Alt+C . For instance, just copy the paragraph above. Then place the cursor anywhere where a paragraph would be valid, and then use the \"Paste as reuse\" command, Alt+Shift+V . The text fragment copied will be reused, so you can update it in one place (any place where it's reused), and have it updated everywhere. You'll see that it's reused by the link icon. This very paragraph is an example of this! The text fragment copied will be reused, so you can update it in one place (any place where it's reused), and have it updated everywhere. You'll see that it's reused by the link icon. This very paragraph is an example of this! You can also reuse text fragments like this from one topic to another of course. Just open another topic in a separate tab by Ctrl\/Cmd-clicking it, and then do the same thing. You'll notice that if you try to edit the reused text, you can't. This is by design, so that you do not accidentally just change a reused text fragment. But if you know a change needs to be made in all the places it's reused, you can unlock it: And if you need to check where it's reused to determine if it can be changed, just select to see its Usage information: Topic-in-topic reuse You can reuse a topic within another topic. One of the most common uses for this is the reuse of admonitions (notes, warnings, etc) - i.e specialized topic types. Here's a note as a separate component, reused here: Note that notes and other topic types can be reused within other topics. This is an example of that. Try it out for yourself! Just select the Insert tab, and then reuse a Component : In the dialog, just select the topic you want to reuse inside the current topic. It can be any regular topic, or a specialized topic like warnings, etc. Note that you need to have the cursor in a valid place for the component reused. For example, if you insert a warning, it needs to be in a place where a warning is valid, in a section, a step, etc. See Also Another very powerful technique for reuse is filtering, see more about this in  Variant Filtering.

Let's try it. So let's say you have content for which you need to create variants for different audiences. For this we use the audience attribute: Example of filtered procedure steps To zip folders on your Mac, do this: Select the folder, right-click, and select Compress . Repeat for each folder. In the terminal, run this command from the parent folder:  for i in *\/; do zip -r \"${i%\/}.zip\" \"$i\"; done . Place the cursor at the filter (funnel) icon , and check the filter attribute on the right in the Element attributes panel. You'll see that the first step is filtered for Beginners, as is the second. The third step is filtered for Experts. What this means is that when you publish, you'll select what variant to publish to, Beginner or Expert. If you select to publish for Beginners, only step 1 and 2 will be shown. If you select to publish for Experts, only one step will appear (the third one above).

"body" : "Ok, bad pun intended... ;-)  Even though Paligo is made to make it as easy as possible, there are a few things that are useful to get the hang of initially to work with structured authoring and XML. But it's a short learning curve, and well worth it to achieve the efficiency, quality, reuse of content, and savings in the long run. So stick with it, and very soon you'll be so used to it it's second nature, and you'll start to see that you can actually author faster than you did in any other environment. Part of this topic is a bit theoretical, and if you prefer to just dive in and start writing topics or fiddle with some of the example topics, feel free to do so, you can always come back to this! However, the first part about \"Creating Elements\" will be very useful to check out even if you're eager to get going! Just like topics are the building blocks of the entire publication (like sections), elements are the smallest building blocks making up those topics. The elements are \"XML\" elements (similar to HTML, but much more powerful). You don't have to learn XML to use Paligo, but a few basics about the element structure that make up Structured Authoring can be good to at least get a taste of. There are many ways to work with content using elements in Paligo: Creating Elements When you write XML content, you are actually creating elements. But to a great extent, Paligo is made to make creating these elements feel just the same as authoring in a Word processor. The easiest way to create elements is perhaps the toolbar, where many of the common elements are found. Just put the cursor where you want it and click the icon for what you need, like a list or a paragraph: Often, when you just need a new paragraph when you are already in one, just hit Enter to get another paragraph. This actually creates a new para element, but it feels the same as it would in any word processor. You also have keyboard shortcuts for many of them. For instance, to create a note, just hit Alt+Shift+N . You'll find the full list in the online help. Last, but definitely not least, you have the Element Context Menu. Just hit Alt+Enter .This will give you each and every element available. Quite a long list, but you can easily narrow it down by starting to type the name of the element. There are \"block\" elements and \"inline\" elements: Block Elements Block elements are elements that take up vertical space on a page, for instance a paragraph. Other block elements are tables, figures, procedures, lists, examples, etc. Here are some examples: The para (for paragraph) element is a block element. This is a para. A sample table. This is a block element. Header Header Text in first row Text in first row Text in second row Text in second row An example figure This figure is a block element. This list is a block element too: First Second Third And finally, besides this note being a block element, notice also that all of these examples are in an...example. (In this case to be more exact, an informalexample ) This is a block element too, and it shows that one block element can be nested (wrapped) in another block element. Inline Elements Inline elements are the type of elements that only occur in line with running text, like bold, italic, footnote symbols, etc. Here are some examples: You an use all the familiar inline formatting elements, like bold , italic , underline . While you can create the elements using the Element Context menu , it is of course easier to just use keyboard shortcuts, just the same ones you're probably familiar with. You can also use shortcuts to create some specialized inline elements like guilabel - to indicate something that is part of a user interface. Use  Alt+G for that. BTW, the keyboard shortcuts were tagged too, as you can see, with the keycap inline element.  By tagging for instance software gui terms with the keycap element instead of just bold or italic or whatever, you can have full control to change the appearance of all those terms at any time. Like having it come out like this:  . The example to show this is by the way another inline element - an inlineimage , used for small images like icons. And so was the mention of the element name - a tag element. Just put your cursor in any of the inline elements, and you'll see it in the Structure Menu: " }
